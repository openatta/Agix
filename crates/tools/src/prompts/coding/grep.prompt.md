A powerful regex search tool

  Usage:
  - ALWAYS use Grep for search tasks. NEVER invoke `grep` or `rg` as a Bash command. The Grep tool has been optimized for correct permissions and access.
  - Supports full regex syntax (e.g., "log.*Error", "function\\s+\\w+")
  - Filter files with the glob parameter (e.g., "*.js", "**/*.tsx")
  - Output modes: "content" shows matching lines, "files_with_matches" shows only file paths (default), "count" shows match counts
  - Use Agent tool for open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds
  - Pattern syntax: Rust regex, the same as ripgrep's default — literal braces need escaping (use `interface\\{\\}` to find `interface{}` in Go code)
  - Multiline matching: By default patterns match within single lines only. For cross-line patterns like `struct \\{[\\s\\S]*?field`, use `multiline: true`; in content mode the result then shows every line a match spans
  - Files ignored by .gitignore, binary files and files larger than 32 MiB are not searched; the result lists any file left out for its size
